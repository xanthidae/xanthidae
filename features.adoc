- "Save current window as versioned migration" ?
   Pro: sets filename for current window, prevents "Window changed. save?" dialog when exiting
   Con: might tempt developers to include everything in a single versioned migration / edit
existing migrations instead of creating new ones

= TODO
- prevent "Filename x.sql exists. Overwrite?" dialog for versioned migrations;
  the filename is automatically prepended with the current timestamp, therefore,
  no file will be overwritten
- versioned + repeatable migrations

= IN WORK

= DONE
- versioned migration (write currently selected text to user-selected file)
- repeatable migration
